           <p class="text-justify"> Cleaning solar panels is one of the cleaning industry's most challenging tasks.
            Solar panels must be installed at a spot where they are directly exposed to the sun because they receive their energy from the sun's beams.
            In light of that, it may be necessary to install solar panels near a building's entrance or in another area that is inaccessible to people.
            It is quite difficult for a person to reach alone.
            You will need the assistance of some really large machines for that.</p>
